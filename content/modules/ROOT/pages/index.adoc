== Validating podman, and an introduction to pods

Validate the environment

____
For this scenario, `+container-tools+` which contains podman and its
depenencies, has already been installed on the system.
____

The feature we will be working with is specific to Podan version 4 and
newer, so first let’s check that podman 4.0.x is installed on the
system.

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
podman --version
----

You should see output similar to this:

[source,text]
----
# podman –version
podman version 4.0.2
#
