== Validating podman, and an introduction to pods

Validate the environment

____
For this scenario, `+container-tools+` which contains podman and its
depenencies, has already been installed on the system.
____

The feature we will be working with is specific to Podman version 4 and
newer, so first let’s check that podman 4.0.x is installed on the
system.

.Command
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
podman --version
----

You should see output similar to this:

.Output
[source,text]
----
# podman –version
podman version 4.9.4-rhel
#

== Introduction to Podman Pods

A pod within podman is a way of grouping containers that make up
services. We can create a pod easily, with the following command.

.Command
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
podman pod create --name my-pod

You should see output similar to this:

.Output
[source,text]
----
# podman pod create –name my-pod
2d95aa4fdaee5f9b612ad018a42a6f48855ff240784c4be3c9c65f540f6c6448 
#
----


Now we can create a container within that pod simply by tellig podman what pod to create the container in.

.Command
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
podman run --pod my-pod -d --name my-httpd docker.io/library/httpd:latest


Again, you should see output similar to this:

.Output
[source,text]
----
68ca89e03e63df047cc59cbf8ecb648b71c136cc4c9611a709577195b2f2b048 
#
----

Now, we can see that our container is running with

.Command
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
podman ps

.Output
[source,text]
----
# podman ps

CONTAINER ID  IMAGE                                   COMMAND           CREATED        STATUS              PORTS NAMES 
09996c7a624b  localhost/podman-pause:4.0.2-1652984291                   2 minutes ago  Up 51 seconds ago         2d95aa4fdaee-infra 
68ca89e03e63  docker.io/library/httpd:latest          httpd-foreground  51 seconds ago Up 50 seconds ago         my-httpd 
#
----


But what is that extra container? `+2d95aa4fdaee-infra+`

That is a special container that runs our pod.  We can see that the pod is up and running, with two containers, even though we only started a single container inside of it.

.Command
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
podman pod ps

.Output
[source,text]
----
# podman pod ps

POD ID       NAME   STATUS  CREATED       INFRA ID     # OF CONTAINERS 
2d95aa4fdaee my-pod Running 5 minutes ago 09996c7a624b 2 
# 
----

In the next step, we'll work with networking within our pod.
