== Validate the environment

____
For this scenario, `+container-tools+` which contains podman and its
depenencies, has already been installed on the system.
____

The feature we will be working with is specific to Podan version 4 and
newer, so first let’s check that podman 4.0.x is installed on the
system.

[source,bash]
----
podman --version
----

You should see the output below -

== podman –version

podman version 4.0.2 ```

With podman verified, we can continue with the scenario.
